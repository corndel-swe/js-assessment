# JavaScript Assessment

Welcome to the Javascript Assessment!

What you are looking at right now is called a _repository_. A repository is a
collection of files containing code, configuration and other things which all
work together to make a piece of software function correctly.

## Problems

In the folder called `problems`, you will find some files which look like
`001.js` and so on. Your task is to try and make all of the code in those files
work correctly.

## Tests

How do you know when the code works correctly? When it passes the tests!

You can run the tests by opening the terminal and running `npm run test:001`,
and so on.

You will see some information in the terminal to show you if your code passes
the tests, or a hint about why it's failing.

> [!HINT]
>
> You can run all of the tests for every problem in one go by running
> `npm run test`.

## Saving your work

In order to save your work, you will need to _commit and push_ your code.

> [!DANGER]
>
> If you close the browser without commiting and pushing, you will lose your
> work.

See the walkthrough below to see how to commit and push your code.

## Walkthrough

Let's walk through the steps to solving, testing, committing and pushing the
first problem.

### Step 1: Codespaces

The easiest way to work on the code is using Codespaces right here in the
browser.
